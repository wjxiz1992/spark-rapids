/**
 * Selects the physical build side for one probe. FIXED or SMALLEST selection modes retain their
 * ordinary choice. Under AUTO, if we already have a cached build, or if the offered side is
 * the smaller side, that side is used. Otherwise, we use a heuristic described below.
 *
 * When there is no build in the cache we have two choices. Define the following:
 *
 *   B = total number of rows in the broadcast side
 *   S_i = number of rows in each stream side batch
 *   M = number of stream side batches
 *   q = normalized cost of probing one row, relative to building one row
 *
 * At the start of the join, our two choices are to 1) build B once and probe with each S_i,
 * or 2) build each S_i and probe with B. The cumulative costs for these two options are:
 *
 *   reuse = B + q * sum(S_i)
 *   onDemand = sum(S_i + q * B)
 *
 * We do not know the values of M nor sum(S_i) upfront. So instead we store accumulators for
 * M and sum(S_i) via `probeCount` and `probeRows` respectively, and use a rent-or-buy
 * heuristic. For a single batch, we compute the additional cost of renting instead of
 * using an already-built broadcast table as:
 *
 *   rent_i = onDemand_i - reuse_i
 *          = (S_i + q * B) - q * S_i
 *          = (1 - q) * S_i + q * B
 *
 * When the rent exceeds the cost of buying, i.e. sum(rent_i) >= B, we will switch from
 * doing onDemand builds to building and caching the broadcast side.
